problem: "How do we install Ruby and run Ruby programs?"
solution: "With Google, StackOverflow, and a little patience."

*This will likely be the most painful, least fun part of the lesson. If you are planning to take the ONA class, I strongly suggest you get this squared away. I will try to finish this chapter as quickly as possible. In the meantime, [Googling plain-language questions about Ruby installation](will get you pretty far.)*

*I wrote a detailed, but now [slightly-outdated primer on installation](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/installation/) for the BBoRuby*


After installing Ruby (1.8 or 1.9 should be fine) and the [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) and [FasterCSV](http://fastercsv.rubyforge.org/) rubygems, you should be able to run this script without raising any errors:

{% include_code A script to test your Ruby installation lang:ruby test-script.rb %}


## For Mac users

Good news. If you're using Mac OS X from 10.5 (Leopard) on, Ruby is pre-installed on your computer.

If you want to get advanced, you can follow the [excellent instructions here](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/). It's actually a lot of copy-and-pasting and downloading dependencies and following the steps.
