solution: "Read each line of a datafile into an Array object."

So we know how to download a lot of URLs really quickly. All we need is a list of those URLs.

We have a list from the Sunlight Foundation. Inside your local data directory, you should have a file named `TK.txt`. The contents look like this:

```

```

It looks like a bunch of jumbled text &ndash; we'll organize it in the next chapter &ndash; but there *are* Twitter usernames there.

At this point, you could do it the non-programmer way, which is copy-and-paste each Twitter username from the `TK.txt` file into your program to access each file.

But we didn't come this far to copy-and-paste 500+ names. How can we get this list of names into some kind of loopable operation?
