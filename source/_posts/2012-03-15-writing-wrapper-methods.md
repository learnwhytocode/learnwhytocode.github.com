# getting a file

# parsing a twitter account info json

# retrieve an array of tweets

# moving code to another file


```

def get_from_url(u)
# pre: u is an address to a file
# returns: a response from the server

end

def form_twitter_account_info_url(screen_name)

end

def form_tweets_page_url(screen_name, page)

end



def get_twitter_account_info(screen_name)

end

def get_tweets_page(screen_name, page)

end

```
