This lesson is intended for beginners, so I can't assume that you know the common operating system features that programmers take for granted. This is a startup guide to get you acquainted with what's beneath the surface of your point-and-click computing.

*As this section is currently a skeleton, refer to the detailed guide I wrote for the [Bastards Book of Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/installation/). At the very least, download one of the recommended free text editors: [TextWrangler for Mac OS X](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/) and [Notepad++ for Windows](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).*
