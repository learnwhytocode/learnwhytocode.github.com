problem: "Adding strings together with plus signs is annoying and hard to read."
solution: "Use the File.join method, which assembles a filename string from multiple strings"
---

The methods we've learned so far are simple:

```
"hello world".length
#=> 11

"hello world".class
#=> String
```

If you've ever used a word-processor, you've probably used the "Find-and-Replace" function. So it's safe to assume that there's a string method that can do that:

TKsub

TKgsub

The point of this chapter is *not* to memorize these method names, but to be familiar with the pattern of **methods** taking in **arguments** (i.e. *inputs*) and returning a value.

We'll be using `File.join`, `sub`, and `gsub` later on, but if you forget their names or what they do, you can look them up easily enough.
